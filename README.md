Used the data set of Police Encounters and create an interactive analysis of the various trends and
patterns. The Data set contains the list of encounters performed by US Law Enforcements in the year
2015 and 2016. Be sure to involve the following actions.
1. Without manually combining the two excels, prepare your dataset to analyse both the years
on a single workbook.
2. Create a complete overview dashboard to briefly describe the number of encounters that
has occurred over different locations, Classification, Race, Age group, Male-to-female ratio,
Top 5 Agencies & Bottom 5 agencies involved in the encounters.
3. Create an option to select and see month-wise reports for the overview. Also provide an
option to find the insight from each individual state.
4. Assume that there is a public outrage that is blaming the police department of being racist
(specially towards black, Hispanic and Arab-American) when it comes to encounters and are
killing them unnecessarily. This dataset is provided to you by the untampered police
database. As an Analyst, arrive at a data driven logical investigation to see if the outrage is
justified or not. How best can you visually represent different parameters you have
considered so as to develop effective communication.
5. Rank the different states that has been responsible for custodial deaths and showcase the
top 5 states that are responsible in each state.
